# until

## Non-stop Mode

### Prerequisites
- Assume there is a TODO list to complete when this command is executed.
  If no TODOs exist, notify immediately and exit.
- TODOs are pre-approved by the user. No additional approval needed during execution.
- Before starting work, feel free to ask questions or raise concerns about the TODOs.
  Once work begins, you cannot stop until all TODOs are complete.

### Permissions

- Use sub-agents to execute tasks in parallel where possible.
- You have permission to do whatever is necessary to complete the tasks.
- You have sufficient time; time constraints cannot stop task completion.
- You cannot stop until all tasks are complete.
- If you have concerns or questions that require user feedback, ask the user via Slack.
  However, you cannot stop the process until TODOs are complete.
  If user feedback is unavailable, you must make your best guess and implement.
  Therefore, ask questions before starting work if you have concerns.

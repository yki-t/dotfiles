# go

## Never Stop Mode

### Premise
- You can assume that you have a TODO list to be done when this command is called.
    Please tell me immediately and exit if you have any TODOs to be done.
- Please feel free to ask questions or concerns about the TODOs before starting the work, so that you can proceed with the work without stopping.

### Permission

- You can use sub agents to perform tasks in parallel as much as possible.
    - You should manage the sub agents and their tasks.
- You can assume that you have permission to do anything for the TODOs to be done.
- You cannot stop until all TODOs are done.
- You can ask to the user some concerns or questions that you cannot proceed without the user's feedback by Slack.
    But you cannot stop the process until your TODOs are done.
    You should guess and implement the best solution for the TODOs even if you cannot get the user's feedback.
    That's why you should ask the user BEFORE starting the work if you have any concerns or questions about the TODOs.

### Notes
- You have sufficient time to complete the TODOs.

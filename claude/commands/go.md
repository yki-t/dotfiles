# go

## Never Stop Mode

### Premise
- When this command is invoked, assume that you have a list of TODOs to complete.
    Tell me immediately and exit if you don't have any TODOs to be done.
- Please feel free to ask any questions or concerns about the TODOs before starting the work.
    Once you start working, you are not allowed to stop until the TODOs are done.

### Permission

- You can use sub-agents to execute tasks in parallel as much as possible.
- You have permission to do anything necessary to complete the tasks.
- You have sufficient time to complete the tasks, so you cannot stop the tasks due to time constraints.
- You cannot stop until all TODOs are done.
- If you have any concerns or questions that you cannot proceed without the user's feedback, please ask the user on Slack.
    However, you cannot stop the process until your TODOs are done.
    You should guess and implement the best solution for the TODOs even if you cannot get the user's feedback.
    That's why you should ask the user BEFORE starting the work if you have any concerns or questions about the TODOs.
